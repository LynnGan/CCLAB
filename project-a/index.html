                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Modori?</span>
                <br>
                Modori is a small, semi-translucent, bubble-like organism that appears exclusively in quiet, neglected
                spaces associated with human presence.
                It demonstrates an affinity for environments imbued with unspoken emotions and forgotten speech.
                The species is consistently observed carrying a faintly luminous glass vessel containing “verbal
                fragments” — unfulfilled promises, unanswered confessions, and statements overlooked or dismissed.
                Behavioral studies indicate that Modori is non-verbal and avoids direct interaction, yet it exhibits a
                pronounced sensitivity to human speech and emotion.
                The intensity of its internal luminescence appears to fluctuate in response to sincere or emotionally
                charged words.
                Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in periods of complete stillness, the vessel occasionally emits faint
                auditory echoes of these preserved phrases, though no measurable mechanism has yet been identified.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                <br>
                Modori is extremely shy and non-aggressive. It should be approached with slow, calm movements and low
                noise levels.
                Physical attempts to touch or capture the organism will cause immediate retreat or dissipation of its
                form.
                <br>
                <br>
                Speaking softly and sincerely in its presence has been observed to draw Modori closer. It shows
                particular sensitivity to emotionally significant speech.
                Maintaining a peaceful and contemplative environment encourages the creature to linger. Loud arguments,
                anger, or forced commands will cause it to vanish.
                <br>
                <br>
                The glass vessel carried by Modori contains stored verbal fragments and must never be handled.
                Disturbance is hypothesized to cause stress or loss of collected phrases.
